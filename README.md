# Discord-AutoBan

Bans users when they join a discord server if their name contains a search term. Only works with simple alphanumeric search terms, but can be expanded on easily.

1. Create a new channel, eg. #banned-users
2. Fill the channel with the search terms to ban new users by, one message per search term
3. If you need to purge pre-existing members, use the $banusers command - anyone with the Administrator permission can use this in any channel
